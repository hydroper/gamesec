# GameSec

GameSec is a cloud-based massive multiplayer game SDK. Features:

- TypeScript
- Client structure
- Server structure
- 2D physics simulation
- 2D display
- DOM user interface

A game done with GameSec typically works by sending the world from the server to the client in a high-frequency and rendering it from the client and sending specific client inputs to the server.

## Work in progress

GameSec is not available.
